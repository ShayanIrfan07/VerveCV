# VerveCV

Make every bullet count.

VerveCV is a multi-user resume evaluation product. Version 1 scores resumes with a deterministic, versioned rubric. It does not call a language model, an embeddings service, or an external grammar API.

Phase 0 records the architecture and the open scoring decisions. Phase 1 is the workspace shell: a Vite frontend, a Fastify API, and shared packages. Resume upload and scoring are not in this build.

## Development

Node.js 22 or newer runs locally. Continuous integration uses Node.js 26, the current Active LTS. pnpm is invoked through Corepack because a global `pnpm` shim may require an administrator install.

```bash
corepack pnpm install
corepack pnpm dev:api
corepack pnpm dev:web
corepack pnpm lint
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm test
corepack pnpm build
corepack pnpm size:check
```

The API listens on `0.0.0.0:$PORT` (`PORT` defaults to 3000). `GET /api/v1/health/live` reports that the process is up. `GET /api/v1/health/ready` stays unavailable until the database check exists.

Authoritative scores stay provisional until the open decisions that affect scoring are approved. A provisional result is not rescaled to 100.
